# Customer Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on customer sales data. The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors that influence campaign response and provide actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

- Explored customer sales data to identify trends and patterns.
- Analyzed the impact of various customer attributes on campaign response.
- Derived insights without involving machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Salary
- Balance
- Marital
- Job & Education
- Targeted
- Default
- Housing
- Loan
- Contact
- Day
- Month
- Duration
- Campaign
- Pdays
- Previous
- Poutcome
- Response (Dependent Variable)

## Key Findings

1. **Age Distribution:** The majority of customers fall within a certain age range.
2. **Balance Impact:** Customers with higher balances tend to respond more positively to campaigns.
3. **Marital Status:** Marital status may/may not significantly affect campaign response.
4. **Contact Communication:** Most common contact communication type is X.

## Campaign Insights

- Average campaign duration and number of contacts per campaign.
- Distribution of days since last contact (pdays).

## Historical Data Insights

2. **Age Segmentation:** Tailor marketing strategies for different age groups.
3. **Communication Experimentation:** Experiment with various contact communication types for optimal engagement.

## Future Steps
